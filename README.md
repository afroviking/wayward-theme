# Wayward Theme

A Quartz-based digital garden template with a custom content structure for Things, Stash, Notions, and Writings.

## What is This?

This is a customized Quartz theme that organizes content into four distinct types:

- **Things** - Quick, fleeting thoughts and observations (stream-like)
- **Stash** - Reference material, building blocks, and notes worth keeping
- **Notions** - Ideas in progress and exploratory thinking
- **Writings** - Complete, coherent long-form pieces

Each piece can be tagged with a "why" value (`keep`, `remember`, `think`, `work-out`, `share`) to capture its purpose.

## Features

- Custom Things feed component with social media-style card layout
- Minimal callout styles for cleaner design
- Custom image handling with galleries and lightbox functionality
- Warm color theme optimized for reading
- Interactive post creation script
